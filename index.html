    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>According to many renewable energy experts, a small "hybrid" electric system that combines home wind electric and home solar electric (photovoltaic or PV) technologies offers several advantages over either single system.Industry Scenario
        Renewable energy sources have a combined installed capacity of 150+ GW.
        As of Feb 2023, Renewable energy sources, including large hydropower, have a combined installed capacity of 178.79 GW. 
        The following is the installed capacity for Renewables:
        <br>
        Wind power: 42.6 GW
        <br>
        Solar Power: 66.7 GW
        <br>
        India has set a target to reduce the carbon intensity of the nation's economy by less than 45% by the end of the decade, achieve 50 percent cumulative electric power installed by 2030 from renewables, and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. India is world's 3rd largest consumer of electricity and world's 3rd largest renewable energy producer with 40% of energy capacity installed in the year 2022 (160 GW of 400 GW) coming from renewable sources.</p>

    <h1>Solar energy</h1>
    <p>img</p>
    <p>India is densely populated and has high solar insolation, an ideal combination for using solar power in India. Announced in November 2009, the Government of India proposed to launch its Jawaharlal Nehru National . 
        <br>
        Some large projects have been proposed, and a 35,000 km2 (14,000 sq mi) area of the Thar Desert has been set aside for solar power projects, sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100 gigawatts. Solar power in India has been growing at a rate of 113% yoy and now dropped to around ₹4.34 (5.4¢ US) per kWh, which is around 18% lower than the average price for electricity generated by coal-fired plants.
        India is also the home to the world's first and only 100% solar-powered airport, located at Cochin, Kerala. India also has a wholly 100% solar-powered railway station in Guwhati, Assam. India's first and the largest floating solar power plant was constructed at Banasura Sagar reservoir in Wayanad, Kerala.
        The Indian Solar Loan Programme, supported by the United Nations Environment Programme has won the prestigious Energy Globe World award for Sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems. Over three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South

    <h1>wind energy</h1>

    <p>The largest wind farm of India in Muppandal, Tamil Nadu.
        The development of wind power in India began in the 1990s, and has significantly increased in the last few years. Although a relative newcomer to the wind industry compared with Denmark or US, domestic policy support for wind power has led India to become the country with the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world.
        As of 30 June 2018 the installed capacity of wind power in India was 34,293 MW, mainly spread across Tamil Nadu (7,269.50 MW), Maharashtra (4,100.40 MW), Gujarat (3,454.30 MW), Rajasthan (2,784.90 MW), Karnataka (2,318.20 MW), Andhra Pradesh (746.20 MW) and Madhya Pradesh (423.40 MW). Wind power accounts for 10% of India's total installed power capacity. India has set an ambitious target to generate 60,000 MW of electricity from wind power by 2022.
        Wind power installations occupy only 2% of the wind farm area facilitating the rest of the area for agriculture, plantations, etc. </p>

<h1>Renewable vs non-renewable energy resource</h1>
    <p>Natural resources can be grouped into two groups: renewable and non-renewable. Renewable resources will naturally replenish themselves over time, like wind, solar, plants, trees, etc. Non-renewable will be gone forever once used, like coal, fuel, etc.
    Renewable energy resource is the energy we derive from many of Earth's naturally occurring resources, including wind, water, and sun. We call these resources renewable or sustainable (as in sustainable energy) since they are inexhaustible.
    The rate at which we're using fossil fuels is too fast. If we don't make a drastic and immediate change in how we"re using them, they could be potentially depleted within our children's lifetime. On the other hand,renewable energy comes from virtually inexhaustible sources. These resources are called nonrenewable energy resource.

    <h1>Case study</h1>
    <p>Solar energy is an important, clean, cheap and abundantly available renewable energy. It
        is received on Earth in cyclic, intermittent and dilute form with very low power density 0
        to 1 kW/m2.Solar energy received on the ground level is affected by atmospheric clarity,
        degree of latitude, etc. The wind turbine captures the wind's kinetic energy in a rotor 
        consisting of two or more blades mechanically coupled to an electrical generator. The 
        turbine is mounted on a tall tower to enhance the energy capture. Numerous wind 
        turbines are installed at one site to build a wind farm of the desired power generation 
        capacity. Obviously, sites with steady high wind produce more energy over the year.</p>

<h1>Which is the better option?</h1>
<p>In this article, we have covered all the information regarding both options. We have also compared them based on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and their advantages and limitations. Both the options are promising and a great alternative to exhaustible fuels, but solar power here takes the crown for being a better option as it is comparatively less expensive.
    It can save produced power and can be installed at small places, making it ideal for residential and commercial purposes. So if you're wondering about, "is solar energy renewable or non-renewable and if you should choose it?" Then the answer is yes!</p>
